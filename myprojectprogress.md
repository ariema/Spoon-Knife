* I would like to work on a project that benefits other people.
* I would also like it to be small enough so that my team is able to make
a real contribution to the project
* Additionally I think that a shared repository would work best for a small team
project because we would be able to have a centralized work flow. However, the team would need to have a 
clear concept in mind so that nobody takes the project in a different direction.
