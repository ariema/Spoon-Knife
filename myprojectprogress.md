* I would like to wokr on a project that benefits other people.
* I would also like it to be small enough so that my team is able to make
a real contribution to the project
* Additionally I think that a shared repositiory would work best for a small team
project becuse we would be able to have a centralized work flow. However the team would need to have a 
clear concept in mind so that nobody takes the porject in a different direction.
